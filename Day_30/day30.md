This Tubers web application is a part of the course that I bought recently for learning django. The course was " Full Stack Django Developer: Freelance Ready", by the one and only Hitesh Choudhary sir. (Learn Code Online) @hiteshchoudharyofficial

For third party login we need a client ID and a secret key. Which we get when we create a developer account for the respected third party app.

Thats it for today 😉
Thank you
