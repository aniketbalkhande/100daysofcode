Day 16 #100daysofcode challenge....
Today with this challenge....
▪️
▪️.
Today I learnt about the authentication system of django.....👾
Django comes up with the user authentication system. It handles user accounts, group permission, cookies and cookie-based sessions📑
▪️
Created a simple working login, logout project......
▪️
▪️
Also I am going to add this authontication feature in my other projects as well...... 🙂Like the other MyDiary project.... So that users can make there own todo's with there own account. And won't get access to other users data.......
▪️
User can just login to the front-end dashboard with the username and password that he is creating in the signup page.
In order to get access to the back-end data you need to create a super user account as always in django....As django comes up with inbuilt admin panel.......

Source code for all my projects is available on my GitHub account.

That's it for today....😉
