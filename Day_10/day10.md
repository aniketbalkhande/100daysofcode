🔸Pandas library:
▪️Pandas is a open-source Pyhon Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures.
▪️Pandas library deals with mainly:
1) Series
2) DataFrame
3) Panel
▪️These data structures are built on top of Numpy array which means they are fast.

🔸 DataFrame :

They are excellent data representation tools.
