Today with this challenge.....
.
Sorry for late posting, trying my best for being consistent in this challenge...üòâ
.
Today with this challenge worked on my WebNavigator project... As you can see in the video, most of the part is completed.
.
I used " https://quotable.io/random " api to generate the fresh quotes.
.
Delete button, form, messages are working fine...... The only stuff remaining is the update website button.

ü§∑I wanted to update it on the same page . Just not getting the idea how to do it. I will try AJAX to get the data but how to update it on the same page...?

‚úåÔ∏èIf you guys have any idea about how to update the data on the same page & then save it to database in django ..... ? Comment down or DM me I'll love to hear.
