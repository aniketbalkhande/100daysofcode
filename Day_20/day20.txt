..Today with this challenge.........
.
Today I learnt about the django ORM, worked on the MyDiery Projects user home page. Added some new stats feature for the number of completed todos, current todos and notes etc. And also fixed some bugs.

Django ORM:
Stands for Object Relational Mapper.
It is just a pythonical way to create SQL to query and manipulate your database and get results in a pythonic fashion.

For Example: 
The query to retrieve all bojects from a table is : 
Blog.objects.all()

where: 
Blog - Model name
objects - Manager
all() - method 

Other methods are :
get() : To retrive a single object.
filter() : 
exclude()
