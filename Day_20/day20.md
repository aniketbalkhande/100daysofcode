..Today with this challenge.........
▪️
🔸Today I learnt about Djangos ORM.😃
🔸 Worked on MyDiary projects user-home page. Added a new feature called stats for the number of completed todos, current todos and notes etc.
🔸And also fixed some bugs.

🔸Django ORM :🤔
▪️It stands for 'Object Relational Mapper'.
▪️It is just a pythonical way to create SQL to query and manipulate your database and get results in a pythonic a fashion.

▪️For Example: 🙂
The query to retrieve all objects from a table is :
👉 " Blog.objects.all() "

where:
▪️Blog - Model name
▪️objects - Manager
▪️all( ) - method

Other most used methods are :
▪️get( ) : To retrieve a single object.
▪️filter( ) : Filter result based on given parameter.
▪️exclude( ) : Returns the results excluding the given parameters.
.
And more than two dozens of other methods are used in djangos ORM.
