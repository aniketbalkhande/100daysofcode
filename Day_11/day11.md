Well how it's going on guys.....? Hope you all are doing grate. Today continuing with django, I worked on my personal portfolio project. This portfolio site will include my personal projects and many informative blogs written by me. As this project is using django as a web development framework, I'm thinking to host it on pythonanywhere.com after its completion. Although this project is in its development phase and a whole lot of code is still there to be written, I'm guessing that it will be on the web within 2-3 days....or may be moreüòÖ

Let's not forgat that building projects is the most important thing in learning any new framework or language üëæ.........
