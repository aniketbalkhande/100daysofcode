.
Today with this challenge...
.
Few busy days for me... I know it's been 10 days since my last post😐...
.
No, it is not procrastination, not at all. Just got busy with my final year project work & internship work...🙍 lots of stuff.
.
So I am continuing the #100daysofcode
.
I am learning Django REST Framework... After giving two Interviews for django devloper role, I understood how important the DRF is🧐.
.
📌So today
🔹I read the DRF. documentation.
🔹Learnt about the PERMISSIONS & AUTHENTICATION.
🔹Installed django-rest-auth.
🔹Learnt about the token generation.
.
Tokens contain all the unique keys for the users when a user sign ups.
.

.
Thats it for today 😉
