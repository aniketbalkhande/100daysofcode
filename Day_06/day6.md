Day 6 #100dysofcode challenge.......
Today with this challenge.......
.
Today I revised my python notes 📝 and solved some problem solving ability questions on hackerrank.
.
And then I started reading this classic book "The power of your subconscious mind" by Joseph Murphy.....📓
.
This book say's : Your mind has two parts, conscious and the subconscious. If you direct the conscious mind to be positive, the subconscious one will bring happiness in your life.........✨
.
Let me know which book you are reading and which book had great impact on your life ?
