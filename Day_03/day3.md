Day 3 #100daysofcode challenge [ view post here ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCyVIxJ9tK/ "Goto Day3 post")

Today with this challenge.............
.
What's up everybody,........... Today I finally got gold badge 5 star in python, it wasn't easy. It took me couple hours of coding in the morning to complete the given tasks. Then I moved to update the typeit project (the 3rd image above)( source code available on GitHub page).
Then in the evening I started reading 'The React Beginner Handbook ' which one of my friend suggested me to read in order to getting started with reactJs and guess what I finished reading it, it was just a 40 page book & consisting of some of the introductory parts like how to install react, intro to react components, props, jsx, state, data flow in a react application, handling user events in react & lastly where to go from here.
.
Not explained in too much details just short intro to every important part in reactJs. But still if someone wants to read it just DM me or I will put a link in comments to download it......
That's it for today...
