Day 13 #100dysofcode challenge.......
Today with this challenge......
.
Hi there, welcome again😀....
▪️
Guess what.......I completed the coding for demo version of my portfolio site🎊........ the mobile first view is working fine.... And desktop view is also pretty good.
▪️
It is a demo version with demo data.....And has a lot of bugs to be fixed.... But the workflow is done you can see by visiting it. The add comments option in blog section is ready....But I have to work on the responsive design for sure.......🙂
▪️
I hosted it on pythonanywhere.com . It is on free tier. I'll will upgrade it on paid version in future as the free tire only giving 512mb of storage. But it's ok to me for now.
