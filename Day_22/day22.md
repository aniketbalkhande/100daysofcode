Day 21 #100daysofcode challenge [ view post here ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNLHcmzJKbu/ "Goto Day22 post")
Today with this challenge.....
.
Today I continued reading django documentation,📝 about the databases specially. Up till now I was using the default dbsqlite3 database in all of my django projects.
.
Thinking to start some projects using other databases like MYSQL, PostgreSQL etc also.
.
For a start, I installed Postgresql and Postgresql admin on my Linux System.
.
So I am working on new project with the postgresql database.
.
Thats it for today...✌️
