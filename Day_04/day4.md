Day 4 #100daysofcode challenge.......
Today with this challenge ..............
.
Today I learnt Numpy module in python, watched tutorial on youtube by Keith Galli for the same.
.
NumPy is a Python library used for working with N-dimensional arrays i.e matrices.
.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, statistics.
.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray. We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
.
To create a data item import the library as:
'import numpy as np'
and then create an array as : np.array([....])

There are various functions in numpy using which we can manipulate the arrays. Some of them are : np.shape(), np.zeros(), np.ones(), np.identity(),
np.reshape(), np.transpose(), np.floor(), np.ceil(), np.rint(), np.sum(), np.prod(), np.eye(), np.concatenate() and many more.
.
The source code for NumPy is located at this github repository https://github.com/numpy/numpy
