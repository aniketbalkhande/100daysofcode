Day 9 #100dysofcode challenge [ view post here ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLmsJGSpSc8/ "Goto Day9 post")
Today with this challenge..........
.
Today I revised object oriented programming concepts....
.
Talking about oops... there are few terminologies..
.
🔸Object :
▪️ Object's are real world entities that communicate with each other using their functionality i.e. method() in a programming world.
▪️ When doing communication they exchange their information via properties i.e. variables.

🔸Class
▪️Classes act's as a blueprint for our object's when all variables and methods are defined.
▪️They allow us to create our own datatypes i.e. user defined datatypes.

There are 4 main concepts in oops:
1) Inheritance
2) Abstraction
3) Polymorphism
4) Encapsulation
.
That's it for today😉
