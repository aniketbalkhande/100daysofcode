Day 1 #100daysofcode challenge [ view post here ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CK9iZiqpDpD/ "Goto Day1 post")

Hay there, what's going on it's Aniket here. Started doing some cool stuff today, a new challenge called #100daysofcode .
.
Let me quickly explain about it, this is a programming challenge where one needs to do coding for atleast one hour each day. It doesn't matter what code you write or which language you use to code alright... and you have to share what you have done with other people's on social media... sound's interesting, isn't it ?........
.
So today I have done some data structures and algorithms questions. Revised algorithms for stack, queues, circular queue some linked list operations. Solved problem's on hackerrank got third 🌟 star in python. Yes that's it for today.
.
Thank you 😀✌️
